Rock Job Interview - Web Project Proposal 
==========================================================================================

## Background

### These are the main technologies that you will be using in our Web Development ecosystem.

* Vue & Vuex
* Typescript
* Protobuf
* IndexedDB
* Sass
* Unit Tests
* E2E Tests

## Objective

### The objective of this project is to evaluate your capability to work with some of the technologies we use daily in Rock. We highly value things like performance and robust tests, so make sure to keep this in mind when doing this projct.

## Tasks

### The main task is to implement a simple kanban board for tasks, for this we have some required tasks you need to complete.

* Fork this repository and use it as the base for your project
* Fetch the tasks from our back-end using the included API and endpoint
* Use Vue and Vuex to render the kanban board

## Bonus Tasks
### These are not required, but highly valued. 

* Implement a simple task search function based on title
* Implement Drag and Drop of tasks to move it from one list to another
* Implement E2E tests
* Implement unit tests
* Implement search engine indexing for faster searches based on title and task body
* Use virtual scrolling to render the lists for better performance
* Use IndexedDB to add a cache layer to your Vuex store
* and anything else you wanna show us

## Design

### This is a simplified version of our own kanban board at Rock.
